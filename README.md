# prime-numbers

This repository can be used for verifying whether a number is a prime or not. The most simple method used to determine whether a number is a prime is "Sieve of Eratosthenes". Essentially it is to mark all multiples of each primes and eliminate these numbers iteratively until only primes left. It is an ancient and simple method to find prime numbers.

There are a few other algorithms used to verify whether a number is a prime number. One of the deterministic one is "AKS primality test" with maximum running time being polynomial. This repository will provide detailed implementation of AKS method.
